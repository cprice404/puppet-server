/**
 * An implementation of LockablePool that uses two semaphores; one to restrict
 * access to the queue for "borrow" requests, and another that is used for the
 * "lock" method to keep track of when all of the outstanding instances have been
 * returned.  (More details below.)
 *
 * One concern that I have about this implementation is that the Semaphore class
 * seems to have really, really strict behavior about which thread gets the lock
 * next, and I'm a bit worried about starving agent requests under high load, but
 * we can explore that further if we decide we're leaning towards using this.
